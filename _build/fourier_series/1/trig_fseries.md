# Trigonometric Fourier Series



Any periodic waveform can be approximated by a DC component (which may be 0) and the sum of a fundamental and harmomic sinusoidal waveforms. This has important applications in many applications of electronics but is particularly important for signal processing and communications.

## Revision?

I believe that this subject has been covered in EG-150 Signals and Systems and so we present the notes as background for the Fourier transform.

## Agenda

* Motivating examples

* Wave analysis and the Trig. Fourier Series

* Symmetry in Trigonometric Fourier Series

* Computing coefficients of Trig. Fourier Series in MATLAB

* Gibbs Phenomenon

## Motivating Examples

This [Fourier Series demo](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mcclella/matlabGUIs#FourierSeries), developed by Members of the [Center for Signal and Image Processing (CSIP)](http://www.ece.gatech.edu/CSIP) at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu/), shows how periodic signals can be synthesised by a sum of sinusoidal signals.

It is here used as a motivational example in our introduction to [Fourier Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series). (See also [Fourier Series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html) from Wolfram MathWorld referenced in the **Quick Reference** on Blackboard.)

To install this example, download the [zip file](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mcclella/matlabGUIs/Zipfseriesdemo-v130.zip) and unpack it somewhere on your MATLAB path.

## Wave Analysis

* [Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier) (21 March 1768 â€“ 16 May 1830) discovered that any _**periodic**_ signal could be represented as a series of *harmonically related* sinusoids.

* An *harmonic* is a frequency whose value is an integer multiple of some *fundamental frequency*

* For example, the frequencies 2 MHz, 3 Mhz, 4 MHz are the second, third and fourth harmonics of a sinusoid with fundamental frequency 1 Mhz.


### The Trigonometric Fourier Series

Any periodic waveform $f(t)$ can be represented as

$$\begin{gathered}
  f(t) = \frac{1}{2}{a_0} + {a_1}\cos \Omega_0 t + {a_2}\cos 2\Omega_0 t + {a_3}\cos 3\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  + {a_n}\cos n\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  \\ 
   + {b_1}\sin \Omega_0 t + {b_2}\sin 2\Omega_0 t + {b_3}\sin 3\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  + {b_n}\sin n\Omega_0 t +  \cdots  \\ 
\end{gathered} $$

or equivalently (if more confusingly)

$$f(t) = \frac{1}{2}{a_0} + \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {({a_n}\cos n\Omega_0 t + {b_n}\sin n\Omega_0 t)} $$

where $\Omega_0$ rad/s is the *fundamental frequency*.

### Notation

* The first term $a_o/2$ is a constant and represents the DC (average) component of the signal $f(t)$
* The terms with coefficients $a_1$ and $b_1$ together represent the fundamental frequency component of $f(t)$ at frequency $\Omega_0$.
* The terms with coefficients $a_2$ and $b_2$ together represent the second harmonic frequency component of $f(t)$ at frequency $2\Omega_0$.

And so on.

Since any periodic function $f(t)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series, it follows that the sum of the DC, fundamental, second harmonic and so on must produce the waveform $f(t)$.

### Sums of sinusoids

In general, the sum of two or more sinusoids does not produce a sinusoid as shown below.

To generate this picture use [fourier_series1.m](fourier_series1.m).

### Evaluation of the Fourier series coefficients

The coefficients are obtained from the following expressions (valid for any periodic waveform with fundamental frequency $\Omega_0$ so long as we integrate over one period $0\to T_0$ where $T_0 = 2\pi/\Omega_0$), and $\theta = \Omega_0 t$:

$$\frac{1}{2}a_0 = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{0}^{T_0}f(t)d t = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(\theta )d \theta)$$

$$a_n = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{0}^{T_0}f(t)\cos n\Omega_0 t\,dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(\theta)\cos n\theta\,d\theta$$

$$b_n = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{0}^{T_0}f(t)\sin n\Omega_0 t\,dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(\theta)\cos n\theta \,d\theta$$

## Symmetry in Trigonometric Fourier Series

There are simplifications we can make if the original periodic properties has certain properties:

* If $f(t)$ is odd, $a_0=0$ and there will be no cosine terms so ${a_n} = 0\; \forall n > 0$
* If $f(t)$ is even, there will be no sine terms and ${b_n} = 0\; \forall n > 0$. The DC may or may not be zero.
* If $f(t)$ has *half-wave symmetry* only the odd harmonics will be present. That is $a_n$ and $b_n$ is zero for all even values of $n$ (0, 2, 4, ...)
    

### Odd, Even and Half-wave Symmetry

**Recall**

* An *odd* function is one for which $f(t) = -f(-t)$. The function $\sin t$ is an *odd* function.
* An *even* function is one for which $f(t) = f(-t)$. The function $\cos t$ is an *even* function.

**Half-wave symmetry**

* A periodic function with period $T$ is a function for which $f(t) = f(t + T)$
* A periodic function with period $T$, has *half-wave symmetry* if $f(t) = -f(t + T/2)$

### Symmetry in Common Waveforms

To reproduce the following waveforms (without annotation) publish the script [waves.m](waves.m).

#### Squarewave

<img src="pictures/square.png">

* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even**function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?


#### Shifted Squarewave

<img src="pictures/shifted_sq.png">

* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even** function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?

#### Sawtooth

<img src="pictures/sawtooth.png">

* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even** function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?

#### Triangle

<img src="pictures/triangle.png">

* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even**function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?

### Symmetry in fundamental, Second and Third Harmonics

In the following, $T/2$ is taken to be the half-period of the fundamental sinewave.

#### Fundamental

<img src="pictures/fundamental.png">


* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even**function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?

#### Second Harmonic

<img src="pictures/2nd_harm.png">


* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even** function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?

#### Third Harmonic

<img src="pictures/3rd_harm.png">

* Average value over period $T$ is ...?
* It is an **odd**/**even** function?
* It **has/has not** half-wave symmetry $f(t)=-f(t+T/2)$?

### Some simplifications that result from symmetry

* The limits of the integrals used to compute the coefficents $a_n$ and $b_n$ of the Fourier series are given as $0\to 2\pi$ which is one period $T$
* We could also choose to integrate from $-\pi \to \pi$
* If the function is *odd*, or *even* or has *half-wave symmetry* we can compute $a_n$ and $b_n$ by integrating from $0\to \pi$ and multiplying by 2.
* If we have *half-wave symmetry* we can compute $a_n$ and $b_n$ by integrating from $0\to \pi/2$ and multiplying by 4.

* As before $a_0=0$
* We observe that this function is even, so all $b_k$ coefficents will be zero
* The waveform has half-wave symmetry, so only odd indexed coefficents will be present.
* Further more, because it has half-wave symmetry we can just integrate from $0 \to \pi/2$ and multiply the result by 4.

Note that the coefficients match those given in the textbook (Section 7.4.2).

$$f(t) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\left(\cos \Omega_0 t - \frac{1}{3}\cos 3\Omega_0 t + \frac{1}{5}\cos 5\Omega_0 t - \cdots\right) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\sum_{n=\mathrm{odd}}(-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}} \frac{1}{n}\cos n\Omega_0 t$$

## Gibbs Phenomenon

In an earlier slide we found that the trigonometric for of the Fourier series of the square waveform is

$$f(t) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\left(\sin \Omega_0 t + \frac{1}{3}\sin 3\Omega_0 t + \frac{1}{5}\sin 5\Omega_0 t + \cdots\right) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\sum_{n=\mathrm{odd}}\frac{1}{n}\sin n\Omega_0 t$$

This figure shows the approximation for the first 11 harmonics:

<img src="pictures/fsq_trig.png">

As we add more harmonics, the sum looks more and more like a square wave. However the crests do not become flattened; this is known as *Gibbs Phenomenon* and it occurs because of the discontinuity of the perfect sqare waveform as it changes from 
$+A$ to $-A$ and *vice versa*.
