<h1 id="Laplace-Transforms-and-their-Applications">Laplace Transforms and their Applications<a class="anchor-link" href="#Laplace-Transforms-and-their-Applications"> </a></h1><h2 id="About-the-Laplace-Transformation">About the Laplace Transformation<a class="anchor-link" href="#About-the-Laplace-Transformation"> </a></h2><p>The Laplace Transformation (named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>) is a useful mathematical tool that is used in many branches of engineering including signals and systems theory, control theory, communications, mechanical engineering, etc.</p>
<p>Its principle benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it enables us to represent differential equations that model the behaviour of systems in the time domain as polynomials in $s$ which facilitates their solution</p>
</li>
<li><p>it converts time convolution (which is how we determine the time-response of a system to a given signal) into a simple multiplication in the $s$ domain</p>
</li>
<li><p>it allows us to model linear time-invariant (LTI) system components using transfer functions and systems by block diagrams</p>
</li>
<li><p>block diagram analysis allows us to readily compute system responses to complex signals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only downside is that time $t$ is a real value whereas the Laplace transformation operator $s$ is a complex exponential $s = \sigma + j\omega$.</p>
<p>In this section of the course we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Laplace Transformation</li>
<li>The Inverse Laplace Transform</li>
<li>Using Laplace Transforms for Circuit Analysis</li>
<li>Transfer Functions</li>
<li>Impulse Response and Convolution</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an optional (non-examined) section on State-space modelling and analysis.</p>
