    "\n",
    "This lab supports the materials covered in [Chapter 3 Laplace Transforms](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/laplace_transform/index) of the course notes. You may wish to refer to the Worksheets [worksheet 4](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/worksheets/worksheet4) and [worksheet 5](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/worksheets/worksheet5) for additional examples to try. \n",

    "### Other formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is available in [HTML](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/labs/lab02/index) format for online viewing and [PDF](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/labs/lab02/lab02.pdf) for printing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use file save as to download the script [laplace_lab.m](laplace_lab.m). Open the script as a Live Script and use the Matlab ``laplace`` and ``ezplot`` functions as appropriate to complete the examples given in the comments in the script.\n",

    "\n",
    "Marks should be be claimed according to how many of the parts of Exercises 2 and 3 have been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should attach the files you wish to claim for to the Lab 2 submission page in OneNote, complete the claim form and turn-in your assignment through Teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to three marks can be claimed according to how much of Exercise 2 you have completed and Exercise 3 is worth an addition 2 marks.\n",
