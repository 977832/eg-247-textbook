# Worksheets

This section links to the PDF versions of the Worksheets used in Class. Versions of these files are embedded in the OneNote class notebook for this module and are in a form that you can annotate in class.

I am providing PDF versions, should you prefer to work with paper or another note taking application.

This is an index to the files arranged by module week.
