You may wish to refer to the Worksheets [worksheet 6](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/worksheets/worksheet6) and [worksheet 7](https://cpjobling.github.io/eg-247-textbook/worksheets/worksheet7) for additional examples to try. \n",

    "## Tutorial: Defining Transfer Functions in Matlab (not assessed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked m-File is a short tutorial introduction to the definition of transfer functions in Matlab. It introduces the Linear Time Invariant (LTI) block and shows how it can be used in analysis. Download, publish and read the file and use it as a reference for later labs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Use the Symbolic Toolbox in Matlab to verify $$V_{\\mathrm out}(s) = \\frac{2s(s+3)}{s^3+8s^2+10s+4}.$$\n",
    "2. Use `roots` to find the factors of the denominator $$s^3+8s^2+10s+4$$ and expand the terms with complex roots to find the quadratic factor.\n",
    "3. Use the inverse Laplace Transform on the rational polynomial with real and quadratic factors to determine the symbolic expression `vout` as a function of time.\n",
    "4. Verify that the response is $$v_{\\mathrm out}(t) = \\left(1.36e^{-6.57t}+0.64e^{-0.715t}\\cos 0.316t -1.84e^{-0.715t}\\sin 0.316t\\right)u_0(t)$$\n",
    "4. Use `ezplot` to plot this result.\n",
    "5. Compare your answer with the numerical solution given by the script.\n",

    "## Lab Exercise 5: Problem Solving in Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the Problems Q1-Q3 from Section 4.7 of Karris 2012 (page 4-21) and use MATLAB to adapt the methods used to solve the problem in Lab Exercise 7 to determine the required solution.\n",

    "## Lab Exercise 6: Complex Impedance and Admittance\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked file solves Example 4.5 from Karris 2012 (Example 5 in the notes). The solution concerns the calculation of the Complex Impedance and Admittance of the Circuit shown in Figure 4.16.\n",

    "Use the same technique to solve Q4 from Section 4.7 (Exercises) of Karris (p. 4-21).\n",

    "\n",
    "Use your student number to give a different set of component values whiles maintaining the relative sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if your number was 876543 you might use:\n",
    "\n",
    "R1 = **8**0 kOhm\n",

    "You may find `doc` or `help` and the symbolic toolbox function ``sym2poly`` useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Do: save a copy of `solution7.m` file as `proj3`. Adapt the script to repeat the computation\n",
    "using component values based on your student number. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. compute and plot the phase response of Gs - see function `angle`\n",
    "2. make a transfer function LTI object `Gs2 = tf(numG,denG)`\n",
    "3. Compare frequency response with result of `bode(Gs2)`\n",
    "4. Plot the pole-zero map of `Gs2` using the `pzmap` function.\n",
    "5. Plot the step response of `Gs2` using the `step` function.\n",
    "6. Compute and plot the response of `Gs2` to the sinusoid using the `lsim` function.\n",
    "7. Repeat the simulation of the sinsoidal response in Simulink - save model as `proj2.slx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save your solution as `proj2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to turn in\n",
    "\n",
    "You should attach your modified version of the file `proj2` along with the Simulink model plus any additional scripts that you wish to claim for to the Lab 3 submission page in OneNote. Complete the claim form and turn-in your assignment through Teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it easiest to audit your completion of these exercises by opening the provided `*.m` files as Live Script files and saving them in this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to 3 marks can be claimed for the mini project and up to 2 marks more depending on how much of Exercises 5-6 you have completed.\n",

    "See [Assessment and Feedback: Labwork Assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U-O2hu_Th369EHp6mdc1_j_7ARew2WosE93cjsW012c/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed marking scheme.\n",
