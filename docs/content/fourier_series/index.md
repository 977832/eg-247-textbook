# Fourier Series

This chapter launches our Introduction to Fourier Transforms with a look at Wave Analsysis and Trigonometric Fourier Series. We will then go on to consider the Exponential Fourier Series and its Applications.

The material in this chapter is based on Chapter 7 (Starting at Section 7.8) of [Steven T. Karris, Signals and Systems: with Matlab Computation and Simulink Modelling, 5th Edition.](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416) from the Required Reading List. Some clarificattion was needed and I used Chapter 4 of [Benoit Boulet, Fundamentals of Signals and Systems](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/swansea-ebooks/reader.action?ppg=150&docID=3135971&tm=1518703383001) from the Recommended Reading List for this.
